The veracity of information on the web and social media is of
increasing concern, especially in light of recent developments in
foreign disinformation campaigns to influence elections and questions
about whether public figures actually said what may be attributed
to them*.  Digital information is easy to manipulate, copy, and
delete, but web archives offer a trusted method for timestamping
the appearance of web pages and their contents.  We will investigate
how web archives can be used to establish the priority of information,
as well as how they can be hacked or used to obfuscate the provenance
of falsified content.  The class will consist of exploring web
archiving mechanics and protocols, reviewing prior research, and
class projects that implement and and replicate current issues
involving web archives.

The class will consist of a mix of presentation and review of the
research results of others, as well as original, project-based work.
